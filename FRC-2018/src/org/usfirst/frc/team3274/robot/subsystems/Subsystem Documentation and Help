THINGS NEEDING DOING

	Check this document for accuracy... Grammatical corrections welcome.

	Add your name under Authors if you changed something
	
	ForkLift needs to become a thing
	
	ClawPistons need to become more than copypasta from DrivePneumatics
	
	ClawPistons need to get a IsClawClosed Boolean for Forklift to work properly
	
	ForkLift TeleOp functions need to be made.
	
	Forklift needs a default command
	
	Forklift.eject needs to have it's negative multipliers determined and set...
	
CLAWPISTONS
	
FORKLIFT

	NOTES
	
	FUNCTIONS

		Eject. Takes a EjectSpeed and thrustTime. Spends thrustTime seconds to throw a cube out of the forklift
		at ejectSpeed power.

DRIVETRAIN

	NOTES
	
		Right Motor power needs to be set to the negative of whatever Left Motor is to drive in a straight line. 
	
		Positive Left Motor power (and negative right motor power) results in the robot driving "forward", irrelevant as that declaration is....
	
	FUNCTIONS
	
		Declares the number of Encoder pulses per wheel rotation
		
		Assigns:
			Sniper Mode Modifier
			Wheel Diameter
			P, I, and D ratios for PID loop motor controls
			Setpoints for PID loop motor controls
			
		Limits motor power to a range between -1 and 1, since that is their maximum value in either direction
		
		Assigns a Controller Deadzone (deadband)
		
		Slaves Side Motors into Left and Right motor groups, to be controlled as a single motor despite being
		three motors each
		
		Creates Snipermode (When active, reduces movement speed to allow finer control)
		
		Creates PID Loops for motor control
		
		Sets a default command (Tank Drive w/ XBOX style controller)
		
		Creates code for Tank Driving and Sniper Mode
		
		Creates functions to get Left and Right Encoder values, and a function to get the average of the two
		
		Creates a stop function
		
		Creates functions to enable and disable PID loops with assigned setpoint variables.

DRIVEPNEUMATICS

	NOTES
	
	None... yet.
	
	FUNCTIONS
	
	Creates functions to shift gears w/ pneumatics
	
	Creates a function to deactivate the pneumatics

ROBOTCOMPRESSOR

	NOTES
	
	None... yet.
	
	FUNCTIONS
	
	Creates a Compressor object
	
	Creates Start and Stop functions for the compressor

EXAMPLESUBSYSTEM

It's an example... it exists solely to be copypasta'd as an aid in creating new subsystems.
